# IPIN21Data

This is one of the first data sets with 5G simulation concept in two different experiments, so called Eight and Zero2four. 
It contains map material for HCU-building (Henning-Voscherau-Platz 1, 20457 Hamburg).
The sensor data as well as reference points (waypoints) are also available. The test device is: Samsung S10 5G (built in 2020)

This dataset can be used for indoor localization approaches such as PDR, PF and KF.
You can read the data and run a simple PDR by: 3DPDR.py
